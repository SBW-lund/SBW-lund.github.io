The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop, or SBW for short, is an annual event that has been organized by different universities in Sweden since 2000. This year it will take place in Lund since it is being arranged by Lund University. The target group is traditionally PhD students and postdocs working with any kind of bioinformatics and computational biology. This workshop aims to bring together talented students and young researchers across faculties and universities from throughout the country.

This year SBW will be a hybrid event. This means that we will have a limited number of participants on site, but we will live stream all talks on Zoom. Registration will stay open until October 12th for those that would like to join virtually.
