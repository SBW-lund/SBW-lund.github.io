The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop, or SBW for short, is an annual event that has been organized by different universities in Sweden since 2000. This year it will take place in Lund (hopefully in person) since it is being arranged by Lund University. The target group is traditionally PhD students and postdocs working with any kind of bioinformatics and computational biology. This workshop aims to bring together talented students and young researchers across faculties and universities from throughout the country.

We are all eager to have a decision on whether the event will be in person or online. The organizing committee is currently waiting for guidelines from Lund University for the fall term regarding the pandemic, guidelines that should be out by mid-September. As soon as we have those, a decision will be made on whether we can keep the hybrid format we have been preparing for you (and how many will be allowed to attend in person) or if SBW will be completely online. We would love to meet everyone in Lund, but we need to consider the safety of all participants. Thank you very much for your patience!

If you would like to attend SBW2021, now is the time to register. And if you have any questions, just contact us!
