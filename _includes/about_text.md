The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop, or SBW for short, is an annual event that has been organized by different universities in Sweden since 2000. This year it will take place in Lund (hopefully in person at MatteAnnexet) since it is being arranged by Lund University. The target group is traditionally PhD students and postdocs working with any kind of bioinformatics and computational biology. This workshop aims to bring together talented students and young researchers across faculties and universities from throughout the country. If you would like to attend SBW2021, please register (*registration will open soon*). If you have any questions, please contact us!
