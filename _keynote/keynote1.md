The Gale Hammell lab uses a combination of computational and experimental methods to understand how gene regulatory networks are perturbed in human disease. This includes an emphasis on developing novel tools for the statistical analysis of high-throughput data, developing novel algorithms for modeling the flow of signals through genetic pathways, and importantly, testing these models using the tools of molecular genetics. One particular focus of the M. Hammell lab is to apply these novel statistical analysis methods to better understand how transposable elements are normally controlled. Mounting evidence has implicated transposon activity in a host of human diseases, with particular evidence for activation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).  By combining the power of systems-level, high-throughput data analysis with patient-derived ALS, FTD, and AD tissue samples, the lab aims to better understand how these viral-like sequences contribute to cell death and disease.
