Fabian is the director of the Institute of Computational Biology at the Helmholtz Center Munich and scientific director of the Helmholtz Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Unit (HelmholtzAI) which was launched in 2019. He is a full professor at the Technical University of Munich, holding the chair ‘Mathematical Modelling of Biological Systems’, associate faculty at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute as well as adjunct faculty at the Northwestern University. Fabian holds a Master’s degree in Mathematics and Physics and Ph.D. Degrees in Physics and Computer Science. He worked as visiting researcher at the Department of Architecture and Computer Technology (University of Granada, Spain), at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute (Wako, Japan), at FAMU-FSU (Florida State University, USA), and TUAT’s Laboratory for Signal and Image Processing (Tokyo, Japan), and headed the ‘signal processing & information theory’ group at the Institute of Biophysics (Regensburg, Germany). In 2006, he started working as a Bernstein fellow leading a junior research group at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, located at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation at Göttingen. In summer 2007, Fabian became working group head of CMB at the Institute of Bioinformatics at the Helmholtz Center Munich. In spring 2009, he became associate Professor for Mathematics in Systems Biology at the Math Department of the TU Munich. 2009-2014 he was a member of the ‘Young Academy’ (founded by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina) and was awarded an ERC starting grant in 2010. In 2017 he was awarded the Erwin Schrödinger prize together within an interdisciplinary team at the ETH Zürich. Fabian is part of and also coordinates various consortia (i.e. sparse2big involving 8 Helmholtz Centers) and founded the network SingleCellOmics Germany (SCOG). Furthermore, he coordinates the 2019-launched Munich School for Data Science (MUDS) and is co-directing the ELLIS Munich Unit, the local hub of the European Machine Learning network ELLIS. Since 2020, he holds the position of co-chair of the Bavarian AI Council of the Bavarian Ministry for Science and Art and supports the TUM with his expertise as start-up Ambassador.
