Marina has a PhD in Marine Ecology and is docent in Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Gothenburg. For many years her research focus was on genomics of marine organisms and applying NGS tools to non-model, hard-to-sequence organisms. A few years back she became part of the SWEDNA project (https://www.gu.se/en/research/swedna) and now works with testing and developing eDNA methods for biodiversity monitoring.
