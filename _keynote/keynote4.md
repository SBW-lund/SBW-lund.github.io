Oliver Stegle is the Head of the Computational Genomics and Systems Genetics Division at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and group leader at EMBL in Heidelberg, Germany. His group’s main interest lies in computational methods to unravel the genotype–phenotype map on a genome-wide scale. To address this question, the team carries out research at the interface of statistical inference, machine learning and computational biology, pioneering computational methods for integrating large and heterogeneous datasets across individual and at the single-cell level. The methods and models they develop allow for tying together molecular changes with genetic variation and disease phenotypes and are applied in the context of important studies. Their most recent advances are in the area of single-cell genomics, deriving approaches both for interpreting conventional single-cell RNA-seq variability as well for the analysis of data from spatial technologies. A current direction in the lab is to extend the boundaries of single-cell analysis to integrate single-cell RNA-seq with somatic mutations and clonal substructure in tissues. Oliver obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge in Physics in 2009 and worked as a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen. He was a group leader at the EMBL European Bioinformatics before moving to Heidelberg in 2018, where he obtained a full professorship (W3) at Heidelberg University in 2020. He has received several recognitions, coordinates the ELLIS Health program and is an ERC investigator.

About the talk: The study of genetic effects on gene expression and other molecular traits using bulk sequencing has allowed for the functional annotation of disease variants in diverse human tissues. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and multi-omics protocols provide for unprecedented opportunities to greatly increase the resolution of such genetic analyses, allowing to assess gene regulatory effects at the resolution of cell types, cell states and even in individual cells in human tissues. In this talk, I will present computational strategies for analyzing and integrating population-scale multi-omics dataset. I will then describe applications of these strategies to population-scale single-cell sequencing dataset from genetically diverse human iPSCs across differentiation towards a neuronal fate. Our data provide unprecedented opportunities to map regulatory variants both in major cell types but also in subtle subtypes and across cellular differentiation, revealing dynamic changes of regulatory variants. We describe novel disease-relevant linkages of several of the regulatory variants identified, thereby illustrating how this technology can open novel opportunities to study risk factors for human diseases.
