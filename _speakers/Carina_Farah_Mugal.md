Carina is a researcher at Uppsala University. Her research group focuses on fundamental questions of molecular evolution, such as understanding the molecular mechanisms that cause mutations in the genome sequence of an individual and the evolutionary forces that determine the fate of novel mutations over evolutionary time. Their research approach can be characterized as a multi-disciplinary approach, that is a combination of mathematical modeling, methodological developments and genomic data analysis.
