Jonathan received a PhD in Chemical & Biological Engineering from Princeton University in 2016, after which he joined Jens Nielsen's group at Chalmers University as a postdoctoral researcher. He later joined National Bioinformatic Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS) as a bioinformatician until 2021 when he began his current position as a Scientific Data Developer at the BioInnovation Institute (BII) in Copenhagen. At BII, Jonathan is helping to establish their digital infrastructure, which aims to support early-stage life science start-ups with bioinformatic or other data management needs.
