Kristiina is a PhD student at the dept. of IT at Uppsala University, working on an interdisciplinary project where scientific computing is applied in the study of human evolutionary and demographic history. Her main focus is on computational methods for genetic inference and their application to ancient human DNA; designing new methods and adapting existing ones to the context of highly sparse and uncertain data. Her current focus lies in investigating the use of deep learning methods on genotype data, with applications including dimensionality reduction, genetic clustering as well as the study of quantitative traits.
