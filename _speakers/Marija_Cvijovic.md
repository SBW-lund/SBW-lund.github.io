Marija is a professor and group leader in systems biology at the University of Gothenburg. The driving force of her research group is answering fundamental biological questions:  why and how we age. The group is approaching these questions by studying aging in unicellular organisms focusing on damage accumulation, metabolism, and nutrient signaling. We are developing both dynamic (ODE and PDE) and Boolean models as well as methods for model selection together with experimental and theoretical methods for collecting and analyzing data on the single-cell level.
