Sonjaâ€™s group studies the molecular regulation of cell death and lysosomes and their role in various diseases (especially neurodegenerative diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, stroke and cancer) with the aim of finding new treatments. For this, they combine basic cell biology, model organism work, clinical aspects, bioimaging, structural biology and different forms of computational science.
