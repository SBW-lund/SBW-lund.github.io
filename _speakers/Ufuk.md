Ufuk is a Lund University alumni from the Engineering Mathematics Program at LTH. Being drawn into the field of bioinformatics in connection with his MSc thesis project, he carried on with research at Lund University in the Dept of Immunotechnology working on mass-spectrometry proteomics data. There he published papers both on method development and data science application into cancer proteomics. After a short project working on NGS data and antibodies following his PhD, he relocated to Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, where he stayed for 3 years as a postdoc working with phosphoproteomics data, as well as text-mining and systems biology. Currently Ufuk is working at the Quantitative Biology Unit at AstraZeneca in MÃ¶lndal, working on applying graph data science methods on different phases of the drug discovery process.
