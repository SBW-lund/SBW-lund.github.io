Christian earned his MSc and PhD in Bioinformatics and Cancer Genomics at Lund University, working on RNA-seq-based breast cancer diagnostics. Before moving to Sweden he completed his BSc in Scientific Programming in Germany, and worked in software engineering positions in the mechanical engineering and geomonitoring areas in Germany and Switzerland. He now works as Senior Bioinformatician at SAGA Diagnostics--a Lund University spin-out company working on ultra-sensitive cancer diagnostics. In addition to his education and research, Christian has been active in the open source software community for 20 years, first primarily working on the FreeBSD operating system, then also on open source bioinformatics and reproducible research infrastructure projects such as conda-forge, Bioconda, and Biopython.
